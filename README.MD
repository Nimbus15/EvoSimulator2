This is an Food Chain Simulator.
It shows creatures in a food chain. 
The prey is hunted by the predator and the predator is hunted by the superpredator. 
There is a death counter. The Debug Console will show the kill activity. This project can 
be upgraded to be an Evolution Simulator in the future.

Key:
Prey - Larvae
Predator - Bettle
Superpredator - Spider

Guide:
1. Visuals -> a)Sprites 
2. Complexity-> a)Emergence behaviour i) Flocking(Avoidance, Separation, Cohesion)
				   ii) JitterWander
				   iii) SeekAndPurse
				   iv) Movement* (Has element of Steering Behaviour)
             -> b)Mathematics involved.
				
3. Novelty-> a)Prey, Predator and Superpredator
4. Anthropomorphic qualities -> a)Spider rotation adaption
                               b)Emergence behaviour(e.g. Flocking)
                               c)Predator States - Enum
